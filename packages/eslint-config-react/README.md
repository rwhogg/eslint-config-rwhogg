# eslint-config-rwhogg

This is an ESLint configuration file that reflects my opinions.
It is optimized for React projects and extends [my other config](https://github.com/rwhogg/eslint-config-rwhogg).

You probably don't agree with these opinions. That's fine.

Note that I do not accept pull requests to this repo.
